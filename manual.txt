External Libraries Used: 
Scikit, Numpy, MatPlotLib

Command Line Instructions: 
"python classifier.py arg1 arg2 arg3"
where
arg1 is the number of epochs
arg2 is learning rate (gamma)
arg3 is penalty

Eg. "python classifier.py 3 0.01 4"

We will print the accuracy rate for all the digits, for all the epochs when this command is run.

The dataset needs to be in the same directory as the code.

DISCLAIMER: The number of epochs can make the computation time increase. With over 10 epochs, the computation time is over a minute. For the generation of graphs, we have to run for 100 epochs which will take time.

To generate the graphs, comment out the part of the script generateGraphs.py if you don't want to see a certain plot. Otherwise, it will create all the plots.
